This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify diabetes presence using structured medical data. The dataset consists of various health metrics, with the target variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.

Model Overview
Simple CNN Model
A basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was constructed to classify diabetes,a CNN model is used because a simple neural network failed to give an accuracy up to 80%, the highest accuracy gotten after optimization was 78% so I had to use a CNN model and it performed better

Key features of the model include:

Architecture: Comprises two convolutional layers, a flatten layer, and two dense layers.
Activation Functions: ReLU for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer.(binary classification)
Compilation: Uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimizer and binary cross-entropy as the loss function.
  Performance for simple model 

Training Accuracy: 78.39%
Validation/Test Accuracy: 75.97%
Test Loss: 0.4912


Improvements:
L1 Regularization: Applied to convolutional and dense layers.
Dropout Layers: Included after each convolutional and dense layer to prevent overfitting.
Optimizer: Uses the Rmsprop optimizer for better convergence.
Performance:

Test Accuracy: 82.47%
Test Loss: 0.6407
Error Analysis:

Confusion Matrix: [[92, 7], [20, 35]]
Classification Report:
Precision: 0.82 (No Diabetes), 0.83 (Diabetes Present)
Recall: 0.93 (No Diabetes), 0.64 (Diabetes Present)
F1-Score: 0.87 (No Diabetes), 0.72 (Diabetes Present)
Discussion
Comparison of Performance
The optimized model outperformed the simple model in accuracy, achieving 82.47% compared to 75.97%. The confusion matrix reveals improved classification, especially in correctly identifying non-diabetic cases.

Interpretation of Vanilla Model and Optimized Model
The simple CNN model provided a decent baseline, but the optimized model demonstrated significant improvements due to regularization and dropout techniques, which helped mitigate overfitting.

Conclusion
The project successfully illustrates the application of CNNs in medical data classification. The optimized model shows a better ability to generalize and classify diabetes presence, highlighting the importance of optimization techniques in enhancing model performance
