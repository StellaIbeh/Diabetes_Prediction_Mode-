Discussion: Comparison of Performance
The simple model achieved a test accuracy of 75.97%, with notable precision and recall metrics. The optimized model, on the other hand, demonstrated a significant improvement, achieving a test accuracy of 82.47%.

Accuracy: The optimized model outperformed the simple model by approximately 6.5% in test accuracy.
Loss: The test loss for the optimized model is slightly higher (0.6407) compared to the simple model (0.4912), indicating that while it has improved accuracy, there may still be room for improvement in how well it fits the training data.
Confusion Matrix: The optimized model's confusion matrix shows a better distribution of true positives and true negatives, suggesting improved classification performance, especially in identifying diabetes cases.
Classification Report: The precision and recall scores indicate that the optimized model is more effective in identifying both classes (diabetes absent and present) compared to the simple model.
Conclusion
The transition from a simple CNN model to an optimized version incorporating L1 regularization and Dropout resulted in enhanced predictive performance for diabetes classification. The optimized model not only improved accuracy but also better balanced the identification of diabetes cases. This underscores the importance of implementing advanced optimization techniques in machine learning projects to achieve superior results..
